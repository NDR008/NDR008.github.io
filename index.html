    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a nerdy generalist. I consider myself able to communicate (I do not use the word fluent, or able to speak) in varying useful degrees (and in descending order) in English, Maltese, Italian, Japanese and German.
      I actually could program in BASIC much earlir and better than I could speak Maltese at the age of 10.
      But I learnt to drive by the age of 12 much better than I could express myself.
      I learnt to love cars by the age of 16 beyond what I have been able to do for everything else.

      I hold a BEng in with Honors in Motorsports, an MSc in Strategic Engineering Management, another in Computer Science.
      I studied at Stockholm University a module in Ethics of AI.
      I am considering to do an MSc in Psychology next.
      I consider myself a foodie (especially for Pizza), a car fanatic, an AI lover, a human behaviour analyst, and an introvert (duh), but I love to share my ideas.

      <p>
        Deep Reinforcement learning AI on Gran Turismo, PlayStation - PCSX-Redux, Python, Lua, and SAC.
        In this problem I assume the problem to be a realtime problem. This means, the environment continues at its own time-step rate, irrispective of the agent's pace of observation.
        This means observations may slightly lag or be ahead of the ideal timing.
        The actions may also be ahead or in delay of the next environment time-step rate.

        This is highly interesting because most AI applications research in AI (with a few exceptions), rely on direct control of the environment by means of directly pausing the environment, skipping a fixed amount of frames to always be in time, or a combination of.

        I also looked into discrete and continuous action domains (that is another reason the PSX was interesting, because it was design to support both analoge sticks and D-pads).

        The research also included various forms of observation, but heavily dependent on visual observation, processed by a Convolution Neural Network (CNN).

      <p>
This dissertation investigates the performance challenges of a European subsidiary of a large Japanese automotive component manufacturer, and whether such challenges are caused or amplified by the founding and dominant language of the headquarters‚Äô language ‚Äì Japanese.
There is widespread research describing the national and organisational culture differences that could lead to different forms of working styles and values. Also research exists demonstrating the differences of languages ‚Äì contextual to non-contextual, the intertwining of culture and language, and difference in meaning caused even with translation.
There has been research studying the interactions between subsidiaries and headquarters as well as difficulties of communication amongst such offices.
The research conducted a questionnaire on a team of fourteen employees made of a multiple nationalities including Japanese expatriates to Europe, located in one of the offices of the European subsidiaries. An additional questionnaire provided in literature was also employed for a more specific subset of members of the subsidiary ‚Äì operational management at senior manager and director level as well as a human resource manager.
The results found that not all theories such as Hofstede's dimensions are able to predict the results. Even something as small but profoundly meaningful a
small pause or hesitation to reply a question, which was said to be a positive polite gesture in Japanese language, was found to be negatively perceived by the Japanese native speakers, while being of no concern to the rest. It also found that at least some issues are similar to those predicted by prior theories describing the issues that occur between distant headquarters and subsidiaries.
As a result of this research, a couple of more focused recommendations on how to better engage with headquarters could be determined, that should be able to improve against the issues of this team.

      <p>
        A homebrew PSX game that I leaded and coded as part of a Retro Game Jam for 2021. It was the first time I took part in a Jam, and am proud to be one of the first to make a real retro game for this retro-game jam (most faked the look/feel of retro games while developing in Unity).
        PSX game that can run on a PSX emulator or a real PSX (so long it can run unsigned CDs).
        The game works similar to Flappy-Bird in that tapping X increases the bee's speed up.
