    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a nerdy generalist. I consider myself able to communicate (I do not use the word fluent, or able to speak) in varying useful degrees (and in descending order in English, Maltese, Italian, Japanese and German).
      I actually could program in BASIC much earlir and better than I could speak Maltese at the age of 10.
      But I learnt to drive by the age of 12 much better than I could express myself.
      I learnt to love cars by the age of 16 beyond what I have been able to do for everything else.

      I hold a BEng in with Honors in Motorsports, an MSc in Strategic Engineering Management, another in Computer Science.
      I studied at Stockholm University a module in Ethics of AI.
      I am considering to do an MSc in Psychology next.
      I consider myself a foodie (especially for Pizza), a car fanatic, an AI lover, a human behaviour analyst, and an introvert (duh), but I love to share my ideas.

      <p>
        Deep Reinforcement learning AI on Gran Turismo, PlayStation - PCSX-Redux, Python, Lua, and SAC.
        In this problem I assume the problem to be a realtime problem. This means, the environment continues at its own time-step rate, irrispective of the agent's pace of observation.
        This means observations may slightly lag or be ahead of the ideal timing.
        The actions may also be ahead or in delay of the next environment time-step rate.

        This is highly interesting because most AI applications research in AI (with a few exceptions), rely on direct control of the environment by means of directly pausing the environment, skipping a fixed amount of frames to always be in time, or a combination of.

        I also looked into discrete and continuous action domains (that is another reason the PSX was interesting, because it was design to support both analoge sticks and D-pads).

        The research also included various forms of observation, but heavily dependent on visual observation, processed by a Convolution Neural Network (CNN).
